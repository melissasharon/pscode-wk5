// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input number a
Then input + to trigger calculation
Input number b
And then input = to finish adding a and b together 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input chosen number
Create a line that will determine if number is divisible by 2
Input rule that if number is divisible by 2 it is even
Input rule that is number is not divisible by 2 it is odd
Produce result for chosen number

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Input 5 numbers on their own lines
Create rule that adds all numbers together
Continue that rule to divide that total by how many numbers there are
Input line with that result
Create rule that lists numbers in ascending order
Continue that rule to label the smallest and largest numbers respectively
Input results from calculating the average and explaining its meaning
Input results from calculating the smallest and largest numbers and explaining their meanings
